## Business
> We must figure out how to raise our costs. We are a nonprofit, after all.

> You must love your market long before your market loves you. (Assuming it ever does.)

## The Communist Persuasion
> Not content to leave the poor, poor, the Communist enters the scene then leaves them poor, sad, and angry.
