## Advice
> Humans give great advice in terrible ways. We speak in one dimension, write in two, but grasp things in three.

> Much advice is not taken for need of more explanation.

> For efficiency, invest in Rube Goldberg machines.

## Change
> "Those who do not know history are destined to repeat it," but when we know only history, we are often caught off-guard.

## Communication
> A dialogue is more than an exchange of monologues.

> Man does not communicate as well as he thinks he does.

## Contradicting Ourselves
> We speak of science but listen for magic.

## Getting others to do something
> Send them beside the thing and let gravity do the rest.

## To Learn
> Ask "stupid" questions.

## Of Man
> Questions are embarrassing reminders of Man's insufficiency.

### Self-Reliance
> Be wary of he who says, "I trust not only in myself, for I trust in my fellow man also," for what has been fixed in their doing this?
> So what if the matter has been abstracted some:
>   is not Man still trusting in Man?

> Money that is quickly gained is quickly lost.[^mex-folk]

  [^mex-folk]:Upon posting a [blog about this aphorism](http://brandon.zeroqualms.net/money-quickly-gained-is-quickly-lost/), I learned from my friend Arturo Vergara that, despite how I thought of this aphorism on my own, it is also, word-for-word (aside from being in Spanish?), a Mexican folk saying.

## Playing Games and Winning
> Winners play games they are willing to lose.

## Perception
> To see things clearer, sometimes you must take off your glasses.

> A frosted window pane makes us curious while a clear one makes us indifferent.

## Planning
> Make time for the untimely.

## Reading
> Read the words, miss the sentence.

## Saying Something
> A rich family history is conveyed whenever a person implies something. Say a thing flatly and you're a jerk. Heavily imply it and you're a son of a bitch.

## Thinking
> To think is not to think well.

On a related note:

W> To have a thought

W> is not

## To Whom the Person in the Mirror Laughs At
